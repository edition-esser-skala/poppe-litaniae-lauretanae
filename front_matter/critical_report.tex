  –   & –          & The B solo part is missing in \B2. Likewise, ob 1/2 and
                     vla are missing in \B1 (i.\,e., no dedicated staff,
                     no directives in other staves). Moreover, bars 1–12 of
                     vl 1/2 are empty in \B1. Thus, all of these voices
                     were adopted from the respective single source. \\

                     e.\,g., in \lilyDynamics{p} sections.) Bars 20, 24, 36, 49, and
                     91 were emended to accomodate the instrument’s range. \\
